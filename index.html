<p>Ponniyin Selvan is widely considered by many to be the greatest novel ever written in Tamil literature.[1] 
It was first published as a series in the Kalki, a Tamil language magazine, during the 1950s and was later integrated into a novel. 
The craze for the series which was published weekly was such that it elevated the magazine circulation to reach a staggering figure of 71,366 copies – no mean achievement in a newly independent India.</p>

<p>Even today, the novel has a cult following and fan base among people of all generations. 
The book continues to be admired and garner critical acclaim for its tightly woven plot, vivid narration, the wit of the dialogue, 
and the way in which the power struggle and intrigues of the Chola empire were depicted.</p>

<p>A film series adaptation of the novel is in production, being directed by Indian filmmaker Mani Ratnam.
